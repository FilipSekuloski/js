Idea â˜„
The Jedi Archives has long been forgotten, but that should not stop us from rebuilding this masterpiece of knowledge. The JediArchives app is the first step to rebuilding the collective knowledge about the Star Wars universe. The app should help any user that is interested in some Star Wars data to go through the archive and find what they are looking for. A small step for the internet, but a huge step for Star Wars fans.
